                <h4>Avenga International GmbH</h4>
                <p>1. Overview of Data Processing, Legal Basis, and Terminology
                    <br><br>
                    1.1. This privacy statement explains how we process personal data through our online services,
                    including
                    related
                    websites, features, and content (collectively referred to as the “website” or “online services”).
                    This
                    policy applies
                    across all domains, systems, platforms, and devices (e.g., desktop and mobile). For the section of
                    our
                    website intended
                    for job applicants at Avenga, accessible at avenga.com/career (the “Applicant Area”), additional
                    regulations are
                    specified in Article 12 of this policy.
                    <br>
                    1.2. Terms such as ‘personal data’ and ‘processing’ are defined according to Article 4 of the
                    General
                    Data Protection
                    Regulation (GDPR).
                    <br>
                    1.3. The personal data processed through this online service includes usage data (websites visited,
                    access times),
                    communication data (device IDs, IP addresses, location data, browser type, operating system,
                    referring
                    websites),
                    content data (contact form entries), and applicant data (name, contact details, subject areas,
                    application documents).
                    <br>
                    1.4. The term “user” refers to all individuals affected by data processing, including business
                    partners,
                    customers,
                    prospects, applicants, and other visitors to our online services. Terms like “users” are intended to
                    be
                    gender-neutral.
                    <br>
                    1.5. We process personal data in compliance with applicable data protection laws. Data processing
                    occurs
                    only when
                    legally permitted, such as for contractual services (e.g., order processing), legal obligations,
                    user
                    consent, or
                    legitimate interests (e.g., analyzing, optimizing, and securing our online services as per Article 6
                    (1)
                    (f) GDPR,
                    including metrics, advertising, and third-party services).
                    <br>
                    1.6. The legal bases for data processing are as follows: Article 6 (1) (a) and Article 7 GDPR for
                    consent; Article 6 (1)
                    (b) GDPR for contractual obligations; Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR for legal obligations; and Article 6
                    (1)
                    (f) GDPR for
                    legitimate interests.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Security Measures
                    <br><br>
                    2.1. We implement organizational, contractual, and technical measures to ensure compliance with data
                    protection laws and
                    protect data from accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or unauthorized access.
                    <br>
                    2.2. Our security measures include encrypting data transmitted between your browser and our server.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Data Sharing with Third Parties
                    <br><br>
                    3.1. Data is only shared with third parties as legally required. User data is disclosed to third
                    parties
                    if necessary
                    for contractual purposes under Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR or based on legitimate interests for efficient
                    business operations
                    under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
                    <br>
                    3.2. When using subcontractors, we ensure appropriate legal, technical, and organizational measures
                    are
                    in place to
                    protect personal data in compliance with applicable laws.
                    <br>
                    3.3. If third-party services or content providers from outside the EU or EEA are involved, data may
                    be
                    transferred to
                    their countries. Such transfers are governed by adequate data protection levels, user consent, or
                    other
                    legal
                    provisions.
                    <br>
                    3.4. Avenga operates as a group, with potential data processing outside the EU, including in Ukraine
                    or
                    the USA, for
                    marketing and other activities. Contracts ensure compliance with EU data protection standards.

                    address sent to and shortened by Google in the US.

                    10 years under § 147 Abs. 1 AO (books, records, management reports, etc.).

                    14. Policy Updates
                    <br><br>
                    14.1. We may update the Privacy Policy to reflect legal changes or alterations in services and data
                    processing. Changes

                    14.2. Users are encouraged to periodically review the Privacy Policy for updates.
                    Equality and Non-Discrimination
                    For readability, gender-specific terms are avoided. We are committed to fair treatment regardless of
                    age, disability,
                    gender, gender reassignment, marital status, pregnancy, race, religion, or sexual orientation. Our
                    goal
                    is to foster a
                    discrimination-free and respectful environment for all employees, customers, and suppliers.
